************Current output method notes

Currently, there is a PHP folder in the design_a_scientist. This holds a php script titled "fromunity" that will export
the data we currently record to a csv titled data. Whenever you make the website, make sure that the that the webgl is built
in the same folder as the php script. Additionally, you may need to update the url the script uses, which can be found in
the Unity script titled "Character_Editor" under the output data method. What has currently been made has already been is
ready to run and can be found in the aformentioned PHP folder.

************Things that still need to be done
-Update main menu
-Make things scale properly
-Pants and shirts
-Background
-Objects (beakers, computers, and other shit)
-Method for letting the user input a gender, maybe a name, maybe other information
-Figure out website hosting
-General ui improvements (aesthetic stuff)


************Additional concerns
I'm working on clothing sprites at the moment. I'm not sure how you want to split everything else with how finicky github is with 
people working on the project at the same time. The only major design choices we haven't really decided upon are handling the background,
extra objects, and general aesthetic decisions.
